					<h3>Check yo self before you wreck yourself</h3>
					<p>"Check yo self before you wreck yourself" was a phone app that we developed at the 2014 Fall Fuse "Heath-care at Home" 						Hackathon. This was basically an aggravate, that would get information from three sources. WebMD, Mayo Clinic, and Wikipedia, and 						would display the symptoms and treatments for the ailment the user entered.</p>

					<h3>Event Findr</h3>
					<p>"Event Findr" was a website that attempted to compile a list of college events, that are open to the public, into a single centralized place that the public could easily access. To achieve this we pulled the information from the colleges RSS feeds and extracted the information contained in the XML files. We then made the information searchable by category, city, and date.</p>
					<p>We, the designers of Event Findr, are trying to further empower our fellow citizens through increasing their access to and awareness of educational resources in their community. Currently, the information that they could use to empower themselves is scattered and not necessarily easy to access. By bringing the information into a central location, citizens will have more ease of access to it, thereby allowing them the possibility to improve both themselves as well as others who are active in their community. We hope to encourage people towards fuller participation within their community. In short, we are attempting to bridge the gap that exists between members of the general public and the community resources that are available to them.</p>
					<p>While compiling the resources for this project, it became evident that the information regarding public events held at universities is not simply accessed.  The degree accessibility to the resources varied greatly amongst the different institutions we attempted to gather information from. In addition, many universities had no means of supplying this data through RSS or XML feeds.  These findings support our hypothesis that there is a need to collect and sort the information in an easy to navigate application to provide the community with access to these events.</p>

                    			<h3>Walmart trips</h3>
                    			<p>Some experimentation with the Walmart API that I did during MHacks 6. The idea was to show the user the furthest Walmart store 						away from them, and then use the Expedia API to book a flight to it. While I was not able to complete this project due to 						technical difficulties, this project advanced my knowledge of both how APIs work as well as javascript.</p>

					<h3>FIMP <small>Fashion in my pocket</small></h3>
					<p>FIMP - Fashion In My Pocket- is an interactive app that is meant to help anyone make the most of their time when it comes to 					packing for trips, organizing their closet, or just picking out something to wear. 
					<p>FIMP is basically a digital closet that belongs to each individual user. Everything in the closet already belongs to the 						owner, so it can't be confused with an online store.</p>
					<!--
					<p>With FIMP, the user could utilize the app to help them prepare for an entire outfit or an extended trip without the hassle of 						figuring out where the cloths are and saving time on how long it'll take.</p>
					<p>The interactive part of FIMP comes with LED lights that can be purchased to put on hangers on each garment the user owns. That 						way, whenever the user selects an outfit for the next day of school or work, or perhaps the next trip, the LED light will 						indicate RED for an outfit that has already been selected for clothes that will be worn, YELLOW for cloths that will be packed 						for a trip or GREEN for cloths that are yet to be selected for anything.</p>
					<p>Other parts of the app include a weather tab that will forecast the weather for upcoming days so the user will be able to 						select what to wear accordingly. FIMP will also allow users when they are out shopping. For example, when the user is out at 						their favorite store and is thinking about purchasing a garment but isn't sure if they have something that will match it, the 						user could open up the FIMP app and look through what is already in their closet to help them.</p>-->

					<p>The concept for this came during the 2015 Spring Fashion / Tech Hackathon at Kent State University</p>
